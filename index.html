<p>What I've noticed from looking at their source code is that the codes were neatly written. Basic HTML template is used from the very beginning of the page. I see a lot of content mixing header and paragraph tags as well. There are some codes that look familiar to me like ul and li but there are many codes that are new to me.</p>
